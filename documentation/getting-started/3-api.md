### ü¶ö Getting Started: 


## API: Page Requests

The demo starter site includes 2 pages:
- `/`
- `hello/:name/` (**name** being a url parameter)

Now, using the backend of your choice, create 2 routes matching the ones from the demonstration structure.\
(we will be requesting the pages UI from those request handlers)

‚ÑπÔ∏è The routes on the backend should always match the routes on the frontend

‚ÑπÔ∏è By default, the Paon server starts on port **3000** and is only accessible locally (localhost), if you need to change those settings, for example if you need the server to be exposed to outside traffic, modify the file: `paon/server.config.json`

### Requesting a Page

As Paon can handle multiple sites, to request a page we need to specify the site name.\
To render a page for **my-site-name** we will send a request to:\
`127.0.0.1:3000/my-site-name/`


#### Client Side Rendering

To request the app shell and let the client side render it, we need to send a `GET` request to the Paon server.

```
GET 127.0.0.1:3000/my-site-name/
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è The app shell can than be used to render any page, it's usefull to have it in cache, as it can be used to display error pages, or as backup.

#### Server Side Rendering

To request a rendered page, we will need to send a `POST` request providing the `url` that we want to render, and the `context` that should be given as prop for the page component.

```
POST 127.0.0.1:3000/my-site-name/
```

Request body (json) :
```json
{
    "url": "/",
    
    "context": {
        "user": {
            "name": "Dracula",
            "age": 875
        }
    } 
}
```

#### Rendered Page Response

The page response is a json object with 2 keys:
- `head`
- `body`

Receiving document fragment instead of a whole document gives us more control over the final document returned to the client (changing title or meta tags etc..), and including the UI is as simple as including the `head` fragment in the document's head, and the `body` fragment in the document's body.
