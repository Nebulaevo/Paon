- 🧩 Developed as a plug and play, framework agnostic solution to handle your frontend
- 🌌 Handle multiple sites from the same service
- ⚡ Asset optimisation & bundling with Vite
- 🔧 Command Line Interface to manage sites and start server

*The Paon Template Server is based on the [bluwy/create-vite-extra : template-ssr-react-ts ](https://github.com/bluwy/create-vite-extra/tree/master/template-ssr-react-ts)*


## What is Paon ?

At its core, Paon is a server that we can query to get the HTML code for a page.\
It has been developed to play the role of a template engine in a classic MVC architecture.

To achieve that it provides :
- a dedicated Node.js environnement to develop frontends with React and TypeScript
- assets optimisation & bundling
- a server exposing an API endpoint allowing to request the app shell of a website for client side rendering, or to render a page server side with a provided context

## Why use it ?

Paon is built primarily to decouple the frontend UI generation from the request handling cycle.

If you would rather use a non-JavaScript backend to handle the requests, database connections, caching...\
But still want to use a React frontend, with other modern frontend tools, assets bundling and server side rendering...\
Paon is made for you.
