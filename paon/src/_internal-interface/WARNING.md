# 🔗 Internal interface 🔒

## ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY ⚠️

The two `_internal-interface` folders ( at `./paon/src/_internal-interface` and `./src/_internal-interface` )\
are two identical folders defining the types of the objects exchanged between the **server part of Paon** and the **frontend part of Paon** :
- The two `_internal-interface` folders are only meant to contain files exporting types.
- The files and exported types have to be **IDENTICAL** between the two folders (one in `src` folder, one in `paon/src`).
